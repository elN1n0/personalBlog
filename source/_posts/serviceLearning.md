Last year, I was tasked with the "perilous" endeavor of budding up with a THIRD grader. Oh no! PLEASE ANYTHING BUT A THIRD GRADER! Why would Sage give up an entire day for this? Eventually, however, the day of service arrived and I met with my 3rd-grade buddy. Despite initial awkwardness, I was finally able to connect with my buddy's love of Minecraft. In addition, as time progressed, I become more and more comfortable with my buddy and we had mucho more fun together. Now I realize why Sage is willing to give up a whole day of academics in exchange for service. Instead of a sacrifice per se, we were learning not from textbooks but through experience.  Even though I did the teaching and mentoring on the projects, our difference in cultures allowed my buddy to teach me many things as well. Nevertheless, there were some obstacles that I had to overcome. Some of the projects that my buddy was doing felt like work and not an exciting learning experience. Additionally, I felt that I was too shy which, combined with my buddy's shyness, resulted in some awkward moments. As a result, I hope in this year's service learning, I will be more open, enthusiastic, and have activities for my buddies which are both education and fun.
