For my first "Who You (I) Are (Am)?" word cloud, I wrote words and phrases which described who I was and what was important to me. The biggest words I included on my word cloud consist of memes, water, and of course, my good friend Arnav. Memes, to me, are constructs full of humor and satire. As such, they provide me escape from the dark depths of Nihilism. Secondly, I had listed water, which not only keeps me hydrated, but is also my favorite drink. When I am extremely thirsty, I do not quench for Pepsi but the tasteless distilled goodness of water. The reason that I chose Arnav as one of, if not, the greatest word on my word cloud is due impart to ability to generate puns at will. Though not particularly punny, Arnav brings a renewed energy wherever he goes.

My second word cloud, answers the question of "What Do You (I) Value?" Here, I listed words such as skeptical, woke, and the phrase "Respect Women". I value skepticism deeply as it resulted in many breakthroughs throughout human history and allows for rational thought. Without it, we would never understand that we are in fact not at the center of the universe and succumb to fake news on facebook. Being woke is also something I hold dear because in today's political climate, we have to be able to be aware of issues that we face today. We cannot ignore the issues, dilemmas, and protests that we are surrounded with daily. Finally, I chose "Respect Women" as one of my phrases because it is almost INCOMPREHENSIBLE that women are not being respected by ALL MEN at this day and age. As AP World History puts it, "Women in hunting and gathering societies provided 70 percent of the food compared to men's 30%."
