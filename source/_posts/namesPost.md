For the first five years of my life, I was Jiajun. However, after coming to the United States, I became Jackie, a name chosen by one of my parents' acquaintances. In school, people often associated my name with Jackie Chan, a famous Chinese action movie star. As a result, I started to enjoy Jackie Chan movies and the humor within them. Nevertheless, I do not believe that my name either fits me or not. For one, I think that names are just mechanisms humans employ to distinguish one from another. Albeit, I do recognize that some people may believe in how names are more than just identifying tags. I, on the other hand, do not agree with this ideology and thus, my name has rarely made me feel insecure or held me back. Nonetheless, people who continuously called me Jackie Chan did annoy me a bit. Moreover, I think that Gogol, the protagonist in *The Namesake* believes that his name hinders him because the name seems foreign and distinct. Gogol, similar to many teenagers, desires to fit in with societal norms and live a normal life. But with a name of a Russian author who became insane and starved himself to death, he thought that fitting in was impossible. Consequently, he began to believe that everything wrong which happened to him resulted from his "strange" name.
